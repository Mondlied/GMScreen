# GMScreen
Some simple Web UI for creating a GM Screen in the browser

## User Interaction

In general the following user interactions are planned:

- **Double Click**: edit the element clicked / create a new block (background only)
- **Mouse Drag**: Move the element (if moveable)
- **Left Click**: Open a menu for more detailed options for the element clicked.

## Planned features

- UI improvements

## "Running" the App

Use "Download ZIP" in the Code dropdown to download the repository contents, extract the achive and open `index.html` in your browser.

As an alternative to the ZIP archive you could just clone the repository as usual...

# Browser compatibility

The app was tested on Firefox 113.0.1 . No work was spent to make it work for other browsers for now.

For mobile browsers several features probably don't work at all.
